Floating-point numbers are approximations, so using the equality operator (==) to compare them is unreliable. 
Instead, subtract the numbers and check if the absolute difference is small. For example:
# Example 4
# The variables e and f can be any floating-
# point numbers from any calculation.
e = 7.135
f = 7.128
if abs(e - f) < 0.01:
    print(f"{e} and {f} are close enough so")
    print("we'll consider them to be equal.")
else:
    print(f"{e} and {f} are not close and")
    print("therefor not equal.")

Bad practice: 
    if abs (e == f)
